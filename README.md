## Getting started using Eclipse

+ Download and unzip  
  [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers] Select and download your favorite Eclipse version (http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)  
  (64-bit Eclipse doesn't work with 32-bit JRE/JDK it will fail without any error message).
+ Start Eclipse  
  Use with Java 7 or higher. 
  You might want to [use -vm in eclipse.ini](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini#Specifying_the_JVM).  
  Close "Welcome" screen.  
  Window, Open Perspective, Other..., Java EE.  
+ Newline settings  
  Make sure that the default text file line delimiter is set to Unix and default encoding is set to UTF-8:  
  Window, Preferences, General, Workspace, New text file line delimiter: Unix, Text file encoding: UTF-8.
+ Maven  
  Make sure Maven is able to access the internet. E.g. when behind a proxy:  
  Window, Preferences, Maven, User Settings, settings.xml should exist and contain proxy configuration.
+ Git  
  Window, Open Perspective, Other..., Git, OK,  
  Clone a Git repository, URI: https://github.com/ibissource/ibis4template.git, Next, Next, Finish.
+ Install Server  
  If no servers are available. Click this link to create a new server...,  
  Apache, Tomcat v7.0 Server (or higher!), Next, Browse..., select the root folder of a Tomcat installation  
  (when not available download  [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)  
  (version 7.0.22 is known to work, but other version are expected to work too)), OK, Finish.
+ Configure Server  
  Double click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Open launch configuration, Arguments, VM arguments, add ```-Dotap.stage=LOC```, OK  
  Next click Modules tab, Add Web Module..., iaf-example, OK, File, Save  
  Right click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Start.
+ Start ibis4template on your local machine  
  Open a webbrowser and goto [http://localhost:8080/ibis4template/](http://localhost:8080/ibis4template/) to check if ibis4template is running

### Trouble shooting
In some cases you might want/need to:
- Rightclick ibis4template, Maven, Update Project..., OK.
- Enable Project, Build Automatically
- Right click Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost, Clean...
- Change newlines in .classpath and org.eclipse.wst.common.component files
  back to Unix newlines.
- Rightclick pom.xml (in ibis4template), Run As, Maven build..., JRE, make sure a JDK
  (not a JRE) is used, Refresh, Refresh resources upon completion,
- The local Maven repository might contain corrupt jar files which for example
  will result in java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
  org/aspectj/lang/ProceedingJoinPoint when starting Tomcat. Remove the jar file
  from the repository to make Maven download the file again.
- Sometimes the m2e tool crashes during the download resulting in corrupted overlays. You can resolve this by cleaning the target/m2e-wtp/overlays directory.
